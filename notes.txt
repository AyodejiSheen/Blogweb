view engines helps us to output dynamic content in the html template on the browser.
EJS is the best with nice features.

all the files (.ejs) must be inside "views" folder when using ejs view engine. OR

also add the code 
app.set('views', 'the name of the folder');
after register ejs view engine



NOW you dont send html files, you render ejs


PARTIALS IN EJS
partials are like component in frontend frameworks to avoid code repetition.
you have to use <%- include('path') %> at where you want to use it in your views files
